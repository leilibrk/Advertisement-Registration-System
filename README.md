# Advertisement-Registration-System
Developed APIs for posting advertisements using Django, MySQL and cloud service systems (i.e., AWS S3, Aiven, RabbitMQ, Mailgun, Imagga). The system receives the userâ€™s ad image, sends it to Imagga for tagging, accepts/rejects it based on its tags, saves the image in S3 and sends an email to the user via Mailgun.
